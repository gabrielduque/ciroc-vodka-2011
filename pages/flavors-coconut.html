				<p>	
					Like original C&Icirc;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> vodka, C&Icirc;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> COCONUT is made using 
					fine French grapes that are cold fermented (not unlike fine wines) 
					and distilled five times – the fifth distillation in a pot still, a process 
					normally reserved for the creation of fine whiskey or brandy. 
					The vodka is then carefully blended with all-natural ingredients 
					– a unique balance of coconut and other tropical fruit essences – 
					to create an exceptionally smooth new liquid.
				</p>
				
				<p><b class="bold-ext">TASTING NOTES:</b><br/>
					NOSE: Fresh coconut with a vanilla edge.<br/>
					TASTE: Creamy sweet coconut with a faint hint of tropical fruit.<br/>
					FINISH: Silky and smooth.
