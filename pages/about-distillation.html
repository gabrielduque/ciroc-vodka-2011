					The C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> fermentation process lasts for two weeks to ensure 
					the best possible flavor. While all vodka is distilled, CÎROC® 
					Ultra-Premium is distilled five times. The Mauzac Blanc ‘heart’ is 
					distilled four times before being blended with the Ugni Blanc 
					grape spirit from Cognac, which is also then distilled four times. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The fifth and final distillation takes place in a beautiful, family 
					owned distillery deep in the Cognac countryside. It is here that 
					C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> is truly created - in a traditional, custom-made, Armagnac 
					style copper pot, just like they’ve done from the beginning. 
					The pot distillation lends C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> Ultra-Premium its 
					amazingly smooth texture.
