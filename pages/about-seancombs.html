					In 2007, Sean partnered with Diageo for a groundbreaking strategic alliance to oversee and manage 
					all branding and marketing initiatives for Ciroc Vodka. Combs said he wanted to work with Diageo 
					because the company understood that "I'm not just a celebrity endorser, 
					I'm a brand builder. I'm a luxury brand builder." Since collaborating with C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup>, Combs has 
					heavily contributed to make this brand a household name. "They're looking for something that
