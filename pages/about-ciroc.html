					One of the world’s only vodkas created entirely from grapes, 
					C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup><br>Ultra-Premium is simply unique. The name is 
					derived from the combination of two French words, “Cime” meaning 
					peak or summit-top and "roche" meaning rock. True to its roots, 
					C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> Mauzac Blanc grapes stem from the high-altitude 
					vineyards in Gaillac, France overlooked by the stony village 
					walls<br>of Cordes-sur-Ciel.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Historically, vodka has been made from natural and local sources 
					of fermentable sugars and starches.  C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> is innovative
					 in its use of cold maceration, fermentation and storage processes.
					   Until now, only the top fine wine producers implemented these practices.
				</p>
				<p>C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> Ultra-Premium Vodka is complex in its creation but 
					complimentary with most mixers from Champagne to Tonic. However you
					 choose, enjoy the clean finish of C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup>!</p>
