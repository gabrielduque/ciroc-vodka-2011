					C&Icirc;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> vodka is made exclusively from grapes for an exquisitely 
					smooth, fresh and innovative vodka experience. The essence of C&Icirc;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> 
					vodka comes from top quality Mauzac Blanc grapes grown in Gaillac, one 
					of the oldest and highest vineyard areas in France. These grapes are left 
					on the vine for an extended period of ripening and are harvested at lower 
					temperatures, to help retain their pure fruit freshness and natural aromas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unlike grain, grapes do not need heat to release their fermentable sugars. 
					Instead C&Icirc;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> vodka uses cold maceration, cold fermentation, and cold 
					storage processes, until now only practiced by top fine wine producers, 
					which further preserve its distinctive freshness and extract a more flavorful 
					combination of the fruit character.
