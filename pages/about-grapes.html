					C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> Ultra-Premium is one of the world’s only vodkas made 
					entirely from grapes. C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> is made from top quality "Snap Frost" 
					grapes; Mauzac Blanc grapes grown in Gaillac, one of the oldest 
					and highest vineyard areas<br>in France.

					Why Grapes?<br/>
					 
					Historically, vodka has been made from natural and local source of 
					fermentable sugars and starches. But CÎROC<sup>&reg;</sup> is an innovation in 
					French craftsmanship, and creates an unexpected vodka experience 
					in a category where being different is rare. Unlike grain, grapes don’t 
					need heat to release their sugars, so CÎROC<sup>&reg;</sup> uses cold maceration, 
					cold fermentation, and cold storage processes. Until now, only top 
					fine wine producers practiced this process. This technique further 
					preserves its distinctive freshness and extracts a more flavorful 
					combination of the fruit character.
