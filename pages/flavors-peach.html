				<p>
					Like original C&#206;ROC<sup>&reg;</sup> vodka, C&#206;ROC Peach is made using fine French grapes 
					that are cold fermented (not unlike fine wines) and distilled five times - 
					the fifth distillation in a pot still, a process normally reserved for creation 
					of fine whiskey or brandy. The vodka is then carefully blended with all-natural 
					ingredients- a unique balance of peach and other tropical fruit essence- to create 
					an exceptionally smooth liquid.

				<p><b class="bold-ext">TASTING NOTES:</b><br/>
					NOSE: Impactful bouquet of berries with a hint of jam. <br/>
					TASTE: Ripe and juicy with berry flavors.<br/>
					FINISH: Refreshingly sweet.</p>
